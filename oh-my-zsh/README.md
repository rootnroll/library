Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) configuration.
In this demo you're given a web terminal that runs zsh shell with Oh My Zsh installed in `~/.oh-my-zsh` directory.

## Using Oh My Zsh

### Plugins

Oh My Zsh comes with a shit load of plugins to take advantage of. You can take a look in the [plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins) directory and/or the [wiki](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins) to see what's currently available.

#### Enabling Plugins

Once you spot a plugin (or several) that you'd like to use with Oh My Zsh, you'll need to enable them in the `.zshrc` file. You'll find the zshrc file in your `$HOME` directory. Open it with your favorite text editor and you'll see a spot to list all the plugins you want to load.

For example, this line might begin to look like this:

```shell
plugins=(git bundler osx rake ruby)
```

To apply your changes in `.zshrc` file, reload the zsh configuration by running `source ~/.zshrc`.

#### Using Plugins

Most plugins (should! we're working on this) include a __README__, which documents how to use them.

### Themes

We'll admit it. Early in the Oh My Zsh world, we may have gotten a bit too theme happy. We have over one hundred themes now bundled. Most of them have [screenshots](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes) on the wiki. Check them out!

#### Selecting a Theme

_Robby's theme is the default one. It's not the fanciest one. It's not the simplest one. It's just the right one (for him)._

Once you find a theme that you want to use, you will need to edit the `~/.zshrc` file. You'll see an environment variable (all caps) in there that looks like:

```shell
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
```

To use a different theme, simply change the value to match the name of your desired theme. For example:

```shell
ZSH_THEME="agnoster" # (this is one of the fancy ones)
# you might need to install a special Powerline font on your console's host for this to work
# see https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster
```

Open up a new terminal window and your prompt should look something like this:

![Agnoster theme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/6316862/70f58fb6-ba03-11e4-82c9-c083bf9a6574.png)

In case you did not find a suitable theme for your needs, please have a look at the wiki for [more of them](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/External-themes).

If you're feeling feisty, you can let the computer select one randomly for you each time you open a new terminal window.


```shell
ZSH_THEME="random" # (...please let it be pie... please be some pie..)
```
